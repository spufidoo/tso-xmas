# tso-xmas

With respects to Ken MacKenzie (October 1999), I bring you the TSO XMAS tree.

Unless you have access to an IBM Mainframe, this application is pretty useless. However, if you do, it's fun!

# Installation

Copy the plib/xmas.plib file into a member of your PLIB library, the exec/xmas.rexx into a member of your EXEC library, and type TSO XMIT on the command line to execute.

Merry Christmas!
